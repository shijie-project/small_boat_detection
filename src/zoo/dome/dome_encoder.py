Dome-DETR: DETR with Density-Oriented Feature-Query Manipulation for Efficient Tiny Object Detection
Copyright (c) 2025 The Dome-DETR Authors. All Rights Reserved.

The Dome encoder: ``HybridEncoder`` with the two Dome additions in its ``enhance`` hook.

- DeFE, a light density head on the stride-4 level, predicts a per-pixel object density map and a
  per-image count. The criterion supervises the map with a Gaussian heatmap drawn from the boxes;
  the decoder sizes its query budget from the pooled map.
- MWAS runs a window attention over the stride-8 level restricted to the windows the density map
  marks as populated, and hands the decoder that window mask.
